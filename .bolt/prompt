When you see comments in the codebase tagged with `// BOLTODO: ...` or `/* BOLTODO: ... */`,
please implement the change described in the comment and change the `BOLTODO:` label to `BOLTODONE:`,
so that I know I can check for changes made.

Also, in your response, please include a list of the BOLTODONE items you just completed (if any)
alongside paths to relevant files, as well as a list of outstanding BOLTODO items (if any) 
alongside paths to relevant files please.
